Project Title: Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

1.Introduction
Predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to the volatile and non-linear nature of financial markets. This project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to predict stock prices for Apple Corp. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to capture long-term dependencies in time series data, making them well-suited for financial data modeling.
The model is built using historical stock price data and aims to forecast future prices based on past trends, providing valuable insights for investors and traders.

2.Objective
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an LSTM-based model to predict future stock prices. The model is expected to:
Learn the historical patterns and trends of stock prices.
Forecast future prices with minimal error to assist in decision-making for investors.

3.Problem Statement
Stock prices are influenced by numerous factors such as market sentiment, economic conditions, and company performance. Accurately predicting stock prices is a complex problem that requires understanding past data patterns. Traditional methods often struggle with the non-linear dynamics of stock prices. Therefore, this project aims to harness the power of LSTM networks to model these complexities and provide more accurate price predictions.

4.Data Description
4.1 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical stock prices for Apple Corp., sourced from Tiingo. The data includes features such as:
Date: The date for each stock price entry.
Open: The opening price of the stock.
High: The highest price of the stock during the day.
Low: The lowest price of the stock during the day.
Close: The closing price of the stock.
Volume: The volume of stocks traded during the day.
The target variable is the closing price, which the model will predict based on historical data.
4.2 Data Preparation
The dataset undergoes the following preprocessing steps:
MinMax Scaling: The stock prices are normalized using MinMaxScaler to scale the data between 0 and 1, which helps the LSTM model converge faster and perform better.
Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the LSTM model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

5.Methodology
5.1 Model Selection
The model chosen for this task is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. LSTMs are a special type of RNN that excel at learning from time series data by retaining long-term dependencies.
5.2 Model Architecture
The LSTM model consists of:
LSTM Layers: To capture the sequential patterns in stock prices over time.
Dense Layer: A fully connected layer that outputs the predicted stock price.
5.3 Training Procedure
Data Preparation: The input data is organized into sequences of past stock prices (timesteps) to predict the future closing price.
Model Training: The LSTM model is trained on the historical stock price data. The model learns the relationships between the stock prices across different days to predict future prices.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) on both training and testing sets to assess its performance.

6.Expected Outcomes
The LSTM model is expected to:
Learn from historical stock price data and make accurate predictions on future stock prices.
Minimize prediction error, as measured by metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

7.Challenges and Considerations
Market Volatility: Stock prices are highly volatile and influenced by external factors that are not captured in the data, which can affect prediction accuracy.
Overfitting: Careful tuning of the model is necessary to prevent overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.
Feature Selection: The selection of relevant features, such as technical indicators or external data, can improve the model's ability to capture stock price trends.

8.Future Work
Feature Enhancement: Incorporate additional features such as technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI) or news sentiment data to improve model accuracy.
Model Improvement: Explore more advanced architectures, such as GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) or hybrid models combining LSTM with attention mechanisms, to enhance prediction performance.
Deployment: Develop an application or API that provides real-time stock price predictions to traders and investors.

9.Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of an LSTM model to predict stock prices based on historical data. By leveraging the sequential learning capabilities of LSTM, the model is able to capture complex patterns in stock prices and provide predictions that could be useful for investors. Future improvements could involve integrating more data sources and enhancing the model architecture for even better performance.
